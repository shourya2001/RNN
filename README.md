# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `RNN.ipynb`, that demonstrates the implementation and application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data tasks. The notebook focuses on text data processing, model training, and performance evaluation of RNN-based models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization and sequence padding for text input.
  - Vocabulary generation and word indexing.

- **RNN Implementation**:
  - Build RNN models using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - Explore variations such as Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Train RNN models on sequential data.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plot training and validation metrics over epochs.
  - Visualize predictions and model behavior on test data.

## Datasets

The notebook is designed to work with the following datasets:

- **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**:
  - Sentiment analysis dataset used for binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).

- **Custom Sequential Data**:
  - Users can provide their own datasets formatted as sequences for training and testing the RNN models.

Ensure datasets are preprocessed and tokenized for optimal compatibility with the notebook.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `tensorflow` or `torch` (depending on the RNN implementation)
  - `matplotlib`
  - `nltk` (optional, for preprocessing)

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib nltk
```
Or for PyTorch-based implementation:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch matplotlib nltk
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RNN_Analysis.git
cd RNN_Analysis
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook RNN.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess and tokenize text data.
   - Build and train RNN models.
   - Evaluate and visualize model performance.

4. Modify the code to experiment with different datasets, hyperparameters, and RNN architectures.

## Results

The notebook showcases:
- Comparison of RNN variations (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU).
- Accuracy and loss metrics for model evaluation.
- Visualizations of predictions and insights into sequential data modeling.
